### make sure you have node.js installed - [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or bunjs or deno, whichever works...

## 2. sign in to kasm

- find your kasm token by opening devtools and hitting the network tab, then, going to a request like "get_user_kasms" and going to the "Payload" tab, look for the "token" and "username" parameters, you want to copy the values of these, and paste them in a file you create called ".env"

- keep in mind that sometimes kasm might log you out, so in case it doesn't work, you may want to collect and paste the token again.

make sure to run "npm i" or "pnpm i", "yarn", or "bun install", whichever you use.

### you just start the thing with "npm start" or "pnpm start", or "yarn start" or... "bun start"?

## 4. well done!
